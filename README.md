# Color-Changing-Game

1. INTRODUCTION

So in this project, with the help of python’s Graphical User Interface, we have tried focusing on improving children’s eye-to-hand coordination that also helps improving their typing skills on a computer. In this game, the player has to enter color of the word that appears on the screen and hence the score increases by one, the total time to play this game is 30 seconds. Colors used in this game are Red, Blue, Green, Pink, Black, Yellow, Orange, White, Purple and Brown. Interface will display name of different colors in different colors. Player has to identify the color and enter the correct color name to win the game. 
The Game checks if the entered answer is correct or not. If the answer is correct the score is incremented with 1 point, and incase the entered answer does not match with the actual answer the score is decremented by One point. This will keep the player focused, even for silly typing errors. Thus by making them better at typing.


2. DESCRIPTION

The window starts with the Game description, followed with the score of the current player. Then is the word displayed whose colour will be varying as the player enters it into the text entry box provided below. The window has added colours too attract young players to play it and that they can learn how to speed-type on the keyboard, making them into challenging their friends to see who scores more. Between them is the timer, that shows when the game will end. The timer can be set preferably.

At the end of the window are  the ‘Start’ and ‘Reset’ buttons, that starts the game and Resets the game to the beginning of the game, respectively.


3. CONCLUSION

This therefore improves the eye-to-hand coordination. Where the user eventually learns to skip looking at the keyboard for each word they type. This coordination is useful in most of the outdoor games, where fractional instincts are helpful.
And thereby improves Typing skills, for quicker solving of problems.
